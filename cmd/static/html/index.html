  <h2>What's different about this fundraiser?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>All proceeds from each sale go to the Scout (or Scouts) who make the sale.</strong> Many of the activities available to Scouts have an assoiated cost. Each year each Scout must pay annual dues. Camps have per-scout fees. Specific events
    at some caps have additional fees. Funds raised by individual scouts in this Fundraising Drive can be applied by the Scout toward those fees.
  </p>
  <h2>How it works.</h2>
  <p>
    When you buy a wreath you pay up-front (because the Troop has to pay up-front when placing our final order) and you will receive your wreath or spray at your place of purchase. If you buy at a table sale in front of Holy Name of Mary, you will
    pick up at Holy Name of Mary.
  </p>
  <h2>Can I have a Wreath or Spray sent to someone else?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Yes!</strong> You can have wreaths shipped via FedEx anywhere in the Continental United States. There's an extra cost associated with that, but each shipped wreath will be delivered with fancy gift pachaging, a note that you customize,
    and a certificate stating that a tree will be planted specifically in the recipient's honor.
