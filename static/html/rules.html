    First Annual Troop 28 Chili Cook-off Rules
  </h1>
  <h3>What's a chili?</h3>
  <p class="h4">
    For this competition it's basically anything that includes chili peppers and looks like chili. It can be veggie/vegan. It can be white. It can be paleo. If you can find a way to work nuts into it knock yourself out. Because we are being so loose
    we require that you prominently display a list of your ingredients; we don't want anyone with medical, ethical, or aesthetic priorities eating something that might give them issues.
  </p>
  <h3>How the Competition will be Scored</h3>
  <p class="h4">
    Everyone who attends will get a ballot at the door. Each person will be allowed to vote on their three favorite chilis in rank order. Each vote for 1st will count as three checks for that chili, each for 2nd as two, each for 3rd as one. Most
    checks at the end of the competition wins the trophy. In the end there can be only one.
  </p>
